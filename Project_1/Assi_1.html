    <h1>Backtracking</h1>
    <p></p>
    <p>The usual scenerio is that you are faced with a number of options,and must choose one of these.After you make
        your<br> choice you will get a new set of options; just what set of options you get depends upon what choice you
        made.This procedure is<br> repeated over and overuntil youreach a final state.
        If you made good sequence of choice, your final state is goal state,if <br>you did't is isn't.</p>
    <p>Conceptually, you start at root of tree;the tree probably has some good leaves and some bad leaves, through it
        may be that<br>the leaves are all good or all bad
        .You want to get to a good leaf.At each node,beginning with the root, you chose one of its<br>children to move
        to, and you keep this up until you get to a leaf.
    </p>
    <p> Suppose get to a bad leaf. You can backstrack to continue the search for a good leaf by revoking your most
        recent choice,<br>ane
        trying out next option in that seat of options, if you run out of options, revoke the choice that you got here,
        and try<br>
        anothe choice at that node, if you end up the root wij no options left, there are no good leaves to br found
    </p><br>
    <p>This needs an example.</p>

    <ol type="1">
        <li>Starting at Root, you options Are A and B. You choose A.</li><br>
        <li>At A, your options are cand D.You choose c.</li><br>
        <li>C is bad.Go back to a.</li><br>
        <li>At A,you have already tried C,and it failed.Try D.</li><br>
        <li>D is bad.GO back to A.</li><br>
        <LI>At A, you have no options left to try. Go back to root.</LI><br>
        <li> At Root you have already try A.Try B.</li><br>
        <LI>At B, yours Options are E and F.Try E. </LI><br>
        <Li>E is good.Congratulations!</Li><br>

            sequences of choices we could<BR> make. There is also a data structure called a tree, but usually we don't
            have a data structure to tell us what choices we<br> have. (If we do have an actual tree data structure,
            backtracking on it is called depth-first tree searching.)</p>

            boolean solve(Node n) {
                if n is a leaf node {
                    if the leaf is a goal node, return true
                    else return false
                } else {    
                    for each child c of n {
                        if solve(c) succeeds, return true
                    }
                    return false
                }
            }</pre>
        <p style="background: #E8E8E8 0% 0% no-repeat padding-box;
        border: 1px solid #EDEDED;
        border-radius: 10px;width: max-content;padding: 17px 28px;
        opacity: 1;">Notice that the algorithm is expressed as a boolean function. This is essential to understanding
            the algorithm. If<br> solve(n) is true, that means node n is part of a solution--that is, node n is one of
            the nodes on a path from the root to <br>some goal node. We say that n is solvable. If solve(n) is false,
            then there is no path that includes n to any goal node.</p>
        <p><b>How does this work?</b></p>
        <ul type="disc">
            <li>If any child of n is solvable, then n is solvable.</li>
            <li>If no child of n is solvable, then n is not solvable.</li>
        </ul><br>
        <p>Hence, to decide whether any non-leaf node n is solvable (part of a path to a goal node), all you have to do
            is test whether any <br>child of n is solvable. This is done recursively, on each child of n. In the above
            code, this is done by the lines</p>
        <pre style="border: 1px solid #D8D8D8;
            border-radius: 10px;
            opacity: 1; padding: 33px 22px 21px; 
            text-align: left;
            font: normal normal 300 18px/30px Inter;
            letter-spacing: 0px;
            color: #007EB4;
            opacity: 1;">
                for each child c of n {
                    if solve(c) succeeds, return true
                } </pre>


        <p>Eventually the recursion will "bottom" out at a leaf node. If the leaf node is a goal node, it is solvable;
            if the leaf node is not a goal node,<br> it is not solvable. This is our base case. In the above code, this
            is done by the lines</p>

        <pre style="border: 1px solid #D8D8D8;
        border-radius: 10px;
        opacity: 1; padding: 33px 22px 22px;
        text-align: left;
        font: normal normal 300 18px/30px Inter;
        letter-spacing: 0px;
        color: #007EB4;
        opacity: 1;">
            if n is a leaf node {
                if the leaf is a goal node, return true
                else return false
            }</pre>

        <p>The backtracking algorithm is simple but important. You should understand it thoroughly. Another way of
            stating it is as follows:</p>
        <ul type="disc">
            <li>
                <h3>To search a tree:</h3>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <ol type="1">
            <li>If the tree consists of a single leaf, test whether it is a goal node.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, search the subtrees until you find one containing a goal node, or until you have searched
                them all unsuccessfully. </li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Non-recursive backtracking, using a stack</h3>
        <p>Backtracking is a rather typical recursive algorithm, and any recursive algorithm can be rewritten as a stack
            algorithm. In fact,<br> that is how your recursive algorithms are translated into machine or assembly
            language.
        </p>

        <pre style="border: 1px solid #D8D8D8;
        border-radius: 10px;
        opacity: 1; padding: 33px 22px 22px; 
        text-align: left;
        font: normal normal 300 18px/30px Inter;
        letter-spacing: 0px;
        color: #007EB4;
        opacity: 1;">
            boolean solve(Node n) {
                put node n on the stack;
                while the stack is not empty {
                    if the node at the top of the stack is a leaf {
                        if it is a goal node, return true
                        else pop it off the stack
                    }
                    else {
                        if the node at the top of the stack has untried children
                            push the next untried child onto the stack
                        else pop the node off the stack
                
                }
                return false
            }
            </pre>
        <p>
            Starting from the root, the only nodes that can be pushed onto the stack are the children of the node
            currently on the top of the <br>stack, and these are only pushed on one child at a time; hence, the nodes on
            the
            stack at all times describe a valid path in the <br>tree. Nodes are removed from the stack only when it is
            known
            that they have no goal nodes among their descendents. Therefore,<br> if the root node gets removed (making
            the
            stack empty), there must have been no goal nodes at all, and no solution to the<br> problem.</p>
        <p> When the stack algorithm terminates successfully, the nodes on the stack form (in reverse order) a path from
            the root to a
            goal <br>node.</p>

        <p> Similarly, when the recursive algorithm finds a goal node, the path information is embodied (in
            reverse order) in the sequence of <br>recursive calls. Thus as the recursion unwinds, the path can be
            recovered
            one node at a time, by (for instance) printing the node<br> at the current level, or storing it in an array.
        </p>
        <p>Here is the recursive backtracking algorithm, modified slightly to print (in reverse order) the nodes along
            the successful path:</p>

        letter-spacing: 0px;
        color: #007EB4;
        opacity: 1;">
            boolean solve(Node n) {
                if n is a leaf node {
                    if the leaf is a goal node {
                        print n
                        return true
                    }
                        else return false
                } else {
                    for each child c of n {
                        if solve(c) succeeds {
                            print n
                            return true
                        }
                    }
                    return false
                }
            }</pre>
        <h3>Keeping backtracking simple</h3>
        <p>All of these versions of the backtracking algorithm are pretty simple, but when applied to a real problem,
            they can get pretty <br>cluttered up with details. Even determining whether the node is a leaf can be
            complex:</p>
        <p>For example, if the path represents a series of moves in a chess endgame problem, the leaves are the
            checkmate and stalemate solutions.</p>
        <P>To keep the program clean, therefore, tests like this should be buried in methods. In a chess game, for
            example, you could test<br> whether a node is a leaf by writing a<b>gameOver method</b> (or you could even
            call it
            <b>isLeaf).</b> This method would encapsulate all the <br>ugly details of figuring out whether any possible
            moves
            remain.
        </P>
        <P>Notice that the backtracking altorithms require us to keep track, for each node on the current path, which of
            its children have<br> been tried already (so we don't have to try them again). In the above code we made
            this
            look simple, by just saying <b>for each child<br> c of n.</b> In reality, it may be difficult to figure out
            what the
            possible children are, and there may be no obvious way to step through<br> them. In chess, for example, a
            node
            can represent one arrangement of pieces on a chessboard, and each child of that node can<br> represent the
            arrangement after some piece has made a legal move. How do you find these children, and how do you keep
            track <br>of which ones you've already examined?</P>
        <P>The most straightforward way to keep track of which children of the node have been tried is as follows: Upon
            initial entry to the,<br> node (that is, when you first get there from above), make a list of all its
            children.
            As you try each child, take it off the list. When<br> the list is empty, there are no remaining untried
            children, and you can return "failure." This is a simple approach, but it may require<br> quite a lot of
            additional work.</P>
        <p>There is an easier way to keep track of which children have been tried, if you can define an ordering on the
            children. If there is an<br> ordering, and you know which child you just tried, you can determine which
            child to
            try next.</p>
        <p>For example, you might be able to number the <b>children 1through n,</b> and try them in numerical order.
            Then, if you have
            just tried<br> child k, you know that you have already tried children<b>k-1,</b> and you have not yet tried
            children
            k+1, through n. Or, if you<br> are trying to color a map with just four colors, you can always try<b></b> If
            child yellow fails,<br> you know to try child green next. If you are
            searching a maze, you can try choices in the order left, straight, right <b>(or perhaps <br>north, east,
                south,
                west).</b></p>
        <p>It isn't always easy to find a simple way to order the children of a node.<b>In the chess game example,</b>
            you
            might number your<br> pieces (or perhaps the squares of the board) and try them in numerical order; but in
            addition each piece may also have several<br> moves, and these must also be ordered.</p>
        <h3>Example: Tree Search</h3>
        <p>For starters, let's do the simplest possible example of backtracking, which is searching an actual tree. We
            will also use the <br>simplest kind of tree, a binary tree.</p>
        <p>A binary tree is a data structure composed of node. One node is designed as the root node. Each node can
            reference (point<br> to) zero, one,or, teo other nides, which are called its children. the children are
            refered
            to as the letf child and/or rihgt child.<br> All nodes are reachable (by one or more steps) from the root
            node,
            and there are no cycles. For our purposes, although this is not <br>part of the definition of a binary tree,
            we
            will say that a node might or might not be a goal node, and will contain its name. The<br> first example in
            this
            paper (which we repeat here) shows a binary tree.
        </p>
        <p>Here's a definition of the BinaryTree class:</p>
        <pre style="border: 1px solid #D8D8D8;

        text-align: left;
        font: normal normal 300 18px/30px Inter;
        letter-spacing: 0px;
        color: #007EB4;
        opacity: 1;">public class BinaryTree {
            BinaryTree leftChild = null;
            BinaryTree rightChild = null;
            boolean isGoalNode = false;
            String name;
                
            BinaryTree(String name, BinaryTree left, BinaryTree right, boolean isGoalNode) {
                this.name = name;
                leftChild = left;
                rightChild = right;
                this.isGoalNode = isGoalNode;
            }
        } </pre>
        <p>Next we will create a TreeSearch class, and in it we will define a method makeTree which constructs the above
            binary tree.</p>
        <pre style="border: 1px solid #D8D8D8;
        border-radius: 10px;
        opacity: 1; padding: 33px 16px 16px; 
        text-align: left;

        letter-spacing: 0px;
        color: #007EB4;
        opacity: 1;">static BinaryTree makeTree() {
            BinaryTree root, a, b, c, d, e, f;
            c = new BinaryTree("C", null, null, false);
            d = new BinaryTree("D", null, null, false);
            e = new BinaryTree("E", null, null, true);
            f = new BinaryTree("F", null, null, false);
            a = new BinaryTree("A", c, d, false);
            b = new BinaryTree("B", e, f, false);
            root = new BinaryTree("Root", a, b, false);
            return root;
        }</pre>
        <p>Here's a main program to create a binary tree and try to solve it:</p>
        <pre style="border: 1px solid #D8D8D8;

            BinaryTree tree = makeTree();
            System.out.println(solvable(tree));
        }</pre>
        <p>And finally, here's the recursive backtracking routine to "solve" the binary tree by finding a goal node.</p>

        <p>This program runs correctly and produces the unenlightening result true</p>
        <p>Each time we ask for another node, we have to check if it is null. In the above we put that check as the
            first thing insolvable. An<br> alternative would be to check first whether each child exists, and recur only

            they do. Here's that alternative version:</p>

        <p>I think the first version is simpler, but the second version is slightly more efficient.</p>

        <h3>What are the childre?</h3>
        <p>One of the things that simplifies the above binary tree search is that, at each choice point, you can ignore
            all the previous <br>choices. Previous choices don't give you any information about what you should do next;
            as
            far as you know, both the left and<br> the right child are possible solutions. In many problems, however,
            you
            may be able to eliminate children immediately, without<br> recursion.</p>
        <p>Consider, for example, the problem of four-coloring a map. It is a theorem of mathematics that any map on a
            plane, no matter <br>how convoluted the countries are, can be colored with at most four colors, so that no
            two
            countries that share a border are the<br> same color.</p>
        <p>To color a map, you choose a color for the first country, then a color for the second country, and so on,
            until all countries are <br>colored. </p>
        <p>There are two ways to do this:</p>
        <ul type="disc">
            <li>Method 1. Try each of the four possible colors, and recur. When you run out of countries, check whether
                you are at a goal node.</li>
            <li>Method 2. Try only those colors that have not already been used for an adjacent country, and recur. If
                and when you run out of<br> countries, you have successfully colored the map.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Let's apply each of these two methods to the problem of coloring a checkerboard. This should be easily
            solvable; after all, a <br>checkerboard only needs two colors.</p>
        <h3>boolean mapIsOK()</h3>
        <p>Used by method 1 to check (at a leaf node) whether the entire map is colored correctly.</p>
        <h3>boolean okToColor(int row, int column, int color)</h3>
        <p>Used by method 2 to check, at every node, whether there is an adjacent node already colored with the given
            color.
        </p>
        <h3>int[] nextRowAndColumn(int row, int column)</h3>
        <p>Used by both methods to find the next "country" (actually, the row and column of the next square on the
            checkerboard).</p><br>
        <p>Here's the code for method 1:</p>
        <pre style="border: 1px solid #D8D8D8;
        border-radius: 10px;
        opacity: 1; padding: 33px 30px 29px; 
        text-align: left;
        font: normal normal 300 18px/30px Inter;
        letter-spacing: 0px;
        color: #007EB4;
        opacity: 1;">boolean explore2(int row, int column, int color) {
            if (row >= NUM_ROWS) return true;
            if (okToColor(row, column, color)) {
                map[row][column] = color;

                for (int nextColor = RED; nextColor <= BLUE; nextColor++) {
                    int[] next = nextRowAndColumn(row, column);
                    if (explore2(next[0], next[1], nextColor)) return true;
                }
            }
            return false;
        }</pre>
        <p>Those appear pretty similar, and you might think they are equally good. However, the timing information
            suggests otherwise:</p>
        <table border="1px" align="center">

        <p>The zeros in the above table indicate times too short to measure (less than 1 millisecond). Why this huge
            difference? Either of <br>these methods could have exponential growth. Eliminating a node automatically
            eliminates all of its descendents, and this will<br> often prevent exponential growth. Conversely, by
            waiting to
            check until a leaf node is reached, exponential growth is practically<br> guaranteed. If there is any way to
            eliminate children (reduce the set of choices), do so!</p>

        <h3>Debugging techniques</h3>
        <p>Often our first try at a program doesn't work, and we need to debug it. Debuggers are helpful, but sometimes
            we need to fail<br> back on inserting print statements. There are some simple tricks to making effective use
            of
            print statements. These tricks can be<br> applied to any program, but are especially useful when you are
            trying
            to debug recursive routines.</p>
        <p><b>Trick #1: Indent when you print method entries and exits.</b></p>
        <p>Often, the best debugging technique is to print every method call and return (or at least the most important
            ones). You probably <br>want to print, for each method, what parameters it came in with, and what value it
            leaves with. However, if you just print a long <br>list of these, it's hard to match up method exits with
            their
            corresponding entries. Indenting to show the level of nesting can help.</p>
        <p><b>Trick #2: Use specialized print methods for debugging.</b></p>
        <p>Don't clutter up your actual code more than you must. Also, remember that code inserted for debugging
            purposes can itself <br>contain bugs, or (in the worst case) can affect the results, so be very careful with
            it
        </p>
        <p>Here's our debugging code. For this trivial program, there's almost more debugging code than actual code, but
            in larger programs the proportions will be better.</p>
        <pre

            static String name(BinaryTree node) {
            if (node == null) return null;
            else return node.name;
        }
        static void enter(BinaryTree node) {
            System.out.println(indent + "Entering solvable(" + name(node) + ")");
            indent = indent + "|  ";
        }
        static boolean yes(BinaryTree node) {
            indent = indent.substring(3);
            System.out.println(indent + "solvable(" + name(node) + ") returns true");
            return true;
        }
        static boolean no(BinaryTree node) {
            indent = indent.substring(3);
            System.out.println(indent + "solvable(" + name(node) + ") returns false");
            return false;
        }</pre>
        <p>To use this code, we modify solvable as follows:</p>

        opacity: 1; padding: 33px 30px 29px;

        color: #007EB4;
        opacity: 1;">static boolean solvable(BinaryTree node) {
            enter(node);
            if (node == null) return no(node);
            if (node.isGoalNode) return yes(node);
            if (solvable(node.leftChild)) return yes(node);
            if (solvable(node.rightChild)) return yes(node);
            return no(node);
        }</pre>
        <p>And we get these results:</p>
        <pre style="font-size: 16px;font-weight: bold;">
            Entering solvable(Root)<br>
            | Entering solvable(A)<br>

            | solvable(B) returns true<br>
            solvable(Root) returns true<br>
            true</pre>
        <h3>Trick #3: Never discard your debugging statements.</h3>
        <p>Writing debugging statements is programming, too. Often it's as much work to debug <br>the debugging
            statements
            as it is to debug the actual program. Once your program is working, why throw this code away?</p>
        <p>Obviously, you don't want to print out all this debugging information from a program you are ready to submit
            (or to turn over to <br>your manager). You could comment out your debugging calls, but that can be a lot of
            work. What's more, in the above example,<br> you would have to replace every return(yes(node)) with
            return(true), and every return(no(node)) with return(false). With all these <br>changes, you might introduce
            new
            bugs into your program.</p>

        <p> The simple solution is to make your debugging statements conditional. For example,</p>
        <pre style="border: 1px solid #D8D8D8;
        border-radius: 10px;
        opacity: 1; padding: 33px 30px 29px; 
        text-align: left;
        font: normal normal 300 18px/30px Inter;
        letter-spacing: 0px;
        color: #007EB4;
        opacity: 1;">This is a paragraph.</p>
            ;">static final boolean debugging = false;
            static void enter(BinaryTree node) {
                if (debugging) {
                    System.out.println(indent + "Entering solvable(" + name(node) + ")");
                    indent = indent + "|  ";
                }
            }
            static boolean yes(BinaryTree node) {
                if (debugging) {
                    indent = indent.substring(3);
                    System.out.println(indent + "solvable(" + name(node) + ") returns true");
                }
                return true;
            }
            static boolean no(BinaryTree node) {
                if (debugging) {
                    indent = indent.substring(3);
                    System.out.println(indent + "solvable(" + name(node) + ") returns false");
                }
                    return false;
            }</pre>
        <P>In industry, actual programs often have multiple flags to control different aspects of debugging. Don't worry
            too much about making your code larger; modern compilers will notice that since the variable dibugging is
            final , and the controlled code will be discarded.</P>
        <H3>Trick #4: Create an Exception.</H3>
        <P> If an Exception is thrown, you can get information about just where it happened by sending it the
            message<BR>
            printStackTrace(PrintStream). Since an Exception is an object like any other, you can create and throw your
            own Exceptions.<br> However, Java programmers don't always realize that you can create an Exception without
            throwing it. For example, the following> code</P>
        <pre style="border: 1px solid #D8D8D8;
        border-radius: 10px;
        opacity: 1; padding: 33px 30px 29px; 
        text-align: left;
        font: normal normal 300 18px/30px Inter;
        letter-spacing: 0px;
        color: #007EB4;
        opacity: 1; ">new Exception("Checkpoint Charlie").printStackTrace(System.out);</pre>
        <p>will print out a message something like this, and the program will then continue normally. That is, the above
            code just acts like a print statement.</p>
        <h3>Example: Cindy's Puzzle</h3>
        <p>I call the following puzzle "Cindy's puzzle" for historical reasons. You have some number n of black marbles
            and the same number<br> of white marbles, and you have a playing board which consists simply of a line of

        <p>The black marbles can only move to the right, and the white marbles can only move to the left (no backing

        <p> The backtracking method is named solvableand returns a boolean. In solvable we shall need to check whether
            we are at a leaf,<br> which in this case means a position from which no further moves are possible. This
            isn't
            so easy.</p>


        <p>Now to the program. The main program will initialize the board, and call a recursive backtracking routine to
            attempt to solve the<br> puzzle. The backtracking routine will either succeed and print out a winning path,
            or
            it will fail, and the main program will have to<br> print out the bad news.</p>

        <p> The backtracking method is named solvableand returns a boolean. In solvable we shall need to check whether
            we are at a leaf,<br> which in this case means a position from which no further moves are possible. This
            isn't
            so easy.</p>

        <p> Each possible move will result in a new board position, and these new board positions are the children of
            the current <br>board position. Hence to find the children of a node (that is, of a board position), we need
            only find the possible moves from that node.<br> Remember that it is also highly desirable to find an
            ordering
            on these possible moves</p>

        <p>Here it is time to stop and take thought. To make progress, we must analyze the game to some extent.
            Probably a number of <br>approaches would work, and what follows is based on the way I worked it out. If you
            were to program this puzzle, you might find<br> a different but equally valid approach.</p>

        <p> First, notice that if a marble has a move, that move is unique: if it can move ahead one square, then it
            cannot jump. <br>If it can jump, it cannot move ahead one square. This suggests that, to find the possible
            moves, we might assign numbers to the marbles, and <br>check each marble in turn. When we have looked at all
            the
            marbles, we have looked at all the possible moves. This would require<br> having a table to keep track of
            where
            each marble is, or else somehow "marking" each marble with its number and searching the<br> board each time
            to
            find the marble we want. Neither alternative is very attractive.</p>

        <p> Next, notice that for a given board position, each marble occupies a unique space. Hence, instead of talking
            about moving a<br> particular marble, we can talk about moving the marble in a particular space. If a move
            is
            possible from a given space, then that<br> must be the only move possible from that space, because if the
            marble
            in that space has a move, it is unique. There is a slight<br> complication because not every space contains
            a
            marble, but at least the spaces (unlike the marbles) stay in one place.</p>

        <p><b> Now we have a simpler ordering of moves to use in our program. Just check, in order, the 2n+1 spaces of
                theboard. For each<br> space, either zero or one moves is possible. With this understanding, we can
                write a
                boolean
                method canMove(int[] board, int<br> position)which determines whether a move is possible from the given
                position:</b></p>

        <ul type="disc">
            <li>If the position is empty, no move is possible;</li>
            <li>If the position contains a black marble, the method checks for a move or jump to the right;</li>
            <li>If the position contains a white marble, the method checks for a move or jump to the left. </li>
        </ul>
        <p>We write another method<b> int[] makeMove(int[] oldBoard, int position)</b>that will take a board and a
            position,make a move from<br> that position, and return as its value a new board. (We could write this
            somewhat more
            efficiently by changing the old board,<br> rather than creating a new one, but here we are more concerned
            with
            simplicity.) In technical jargon, makeMove is "applicative"<br> rather than "mutative."</p>
        <p>Along with canMove and makeMove, we are using methods puzzleSolved and printBoard with meanings that<br>
            should
            be obvious.</p>

            Backtracking always produces its <br>results (sequence of choices) in reverse order; it is up to you, the
            programmer, to reverse the results again to get<br> them in the correct order.</p>
