    <P>Q.1 You are provided with two numbers A and . Your task is to add these two numbers.<br>ANS</P>
    <pre>
        const AddTwoNumbers = (a,b) => {
            return a + b
            
        };

    <p>Q.2 You are given two number first as A and B second as and check if both conditions(A < 10 and A > B)
            <br> are satisfied or not with the help of operators.<br>ANS</p>
    <pre>
        const Is_Valid = (a,b) => {

    <p>Q.3You are given two numbers A and B. You need to do the following checks:<br>

        1.if both are divisible by 10 console true.<br>
        2.if both are not divisible by 10 console false.<br>
        3.if one of them only is divisible by 10 console true.<br>
        Use operator to do this.<br>ANS</p>
